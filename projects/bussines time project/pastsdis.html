            <p>Here is the most fast bike in the world</p>
            <p class="hist">The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14 (ZZR1400 in some markets, ZX-14R since 2012), is a motorcycle in the Ninja sport bike series from the Japanese manufacturer Kawasaki that was their most powerful sport bike as of 2007.[7] It was introduced at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show[8] and released for the 2006 model year as a replacement for the ZX-12R. The ZZR1400 is capable of accelerating from 0–60 mph in 2.5 seconds.[9] The top speed is electronically limited to 186 mph (299 km/h) as a result of an agreement between the major Japanese and European motorcycle manufacturers.

The motorcycle was in season 10 of Fifth Gear on October 30, 2006.

Motorcycle USA road tested the bike in its October 10, 2006, issue and posted the following stock results:[2]

60 ft.: 1.713 seconds
330 ft.: 4.349 seconds
1/8 mile: 6.447 seconds, achieving 117.39 mph
1/4 mile: 9.783 seconds, achieving 147.04 mph
2008 saw a minor update. The launch of the 2012 ZX-14R saw a second-generation revision along with getting the R designation.[10] A displacement increase which produced more horsepower, along with three variable power modes and KTRC. Kawasaki traction control and ignition-management system that was lifted from the ZX-10R. Also with cosmetic updates and incremental chassis upgrades and suspension revised internals. There was also a slipper clutch added for the first time. The motor gets cylinder heads with polished ports and cams with more lift and longer duration. Piston are lighter with added compression that get cooled by a new oil jet system. Stronger connecting rods and crankshaft as well as a stronger tensioner and cam chain. while the transmission gets heat treated surface gears. Also in an effort to make the motorcycle run cooler, and therefore be more durable, they added a second radiator fan. Larger head pipes and larger mufflers with a less restrictive air filter all improve response. Motor cyclist recorded Rickey Gadson’s quarter-mile time of 9.64 seconds at 149.83 mph from a bone-stock bike, on a 50-degree morning, at an altitude of 2100 feet.[11] Cycle world recorded a quarter-mile time that produced a record 9.47-second (corrected) at 152.83 mph, and also hit 60 mph in just 2.6 sec.[12]</p>

            <p class="hist">There are two ways to look things up in Wikipedia: by searching or by browsing.

If you know the name of an article for which you are looking, simply type it into Wikipedia's search box.
If you would like to look around the encyclopedia to see what is on it, use Wikipedia's Contents pages. Lists and indices are examples of contents for a published work, and Wikipedia has many of each, including a complete alphabetical index and indices by category.
Links to all of Wikipedia's main contents pages are presented below, and they in turn link to the more specific pages.
Curated article collections
Overview articles
Overview articles summarize in prose a broad topic like biology, and also have illustrations and links to subtopics like cell biology, biographies like Carl Linnaeus, and other related articles like Human Genome Project.

Portal:Contents/Overviews lists overview articles from covered areas of knowledge in a single page.
Outline pages
Outline pages have trees of article links in an outline format. They show how important subtopics relate to each other, and can be useful as a more condensed, non-prose alternative to overview articles.

Portal:Contents/Outlines is a comprehensive list of "Outline of __" pages, organized by subject
Outline of academic disciplines covers subjects studied in college or university, and links directly to prose overview articles
Third-party classification systems
Various third-party classification systems have been mapped to Wikipedia articles, which can be accessed from these pages:

List of Dewey Decimal classes
Library of Congress Classification
Wikipedia:Outline of Roget's Thesaurus
Vital articles
Main page: Wikipedia:Vital articles
Vital articles are lists of subjects for which Wikipedia should have corresponding high-quality articles. They serve as centralized watchlists to track the status of Wikipedia's most important articles.

Vital articles level 1 – 10 most important articles
Vital articles level 2 – 100 most important articles
Vital articles level 3 – 1,000 most important articles
Vital articles level 4 – 10,000 most important articles
Reference collections
Wikipedia has several types of pages which provide content in a non-prose form, for reference purposes.

List pages
List pages enumerate items of a particular type, such as the List of sovereign states or List of South Africans. Wikipedia has "lists of lists" when there are too many items to fit on a single page, when the items can sorted in different ways, or as a way of navigating lists on a topic (for example Lists of countries and territories or Lists of people). There are several ways to find lists:

Portal:Contents/Lists – A limited single-page collection of lists and lists of lists
List of lists of lists – A broad single-page collection of lists of lists
Category:Lists – Browse lists comprehensively via the multi-page Wikipedia category system
Timelines
Timelines list events chronologically, sometimes including links to articles with more detail. There are several ways to find timelines:

List of timelines has a long single-page collection
Category:Timelines has a comprehensive multi-page collection via the Wikipedia category system

List of centuries
List of decades
List of historical anniversaries—e.g. events on January 1 of any year

Category system
Wikipedia's collection of category pages is a classified index system. It is automatically generated from category tags at the bottoms of articles and most other pages. Nearly all of the articles available so far on the website can be found through these subject indexes.

If you are simply looking to browse articles by topic, there are three top-level pages to choose from:

Category:Main topic classifications—probably what you are looking for: Arts, History, Technology, etc.
Category:Fundamental categories—organizes articles into "abstract" ontological categories in a way that every article can reasonably be expected to be classified within it
Portal:Contents/Categories—a hand-crafted list of first- and second-level topic categories
For biographies, see Category:People.

Category:Contents is technically at the top of the category hierarchy, but contains many categories useful to editors but not readers. Special:Categories lists every category alphabetically.

Alphabetical lists of articles
Wikipedia's alphabetical article indexes

Special:Allpages lists all of the current pages in Wikipedia.
Portal:Contents/A–Z index provides an easy way to skip to a particular part of the alphabet in the list of all articles.
Lists of alphabetical indexes

            <p class="hist">Banksia aculeata (nominated by Casliber) is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, it has dense foliage and leaves with very prickly serrated margins. The unusual pinkish, pendent flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, it was not formally described until 1981—by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.</p>
